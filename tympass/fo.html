                    The Current Trend in the DBMS is Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). In RDBMS the data 
            should be stored in the form of tables.The important feature in RDBMS is that it is a single database,it can spread 
            into several tables and each database contains the single table.

                    The second course of Mr. EliÃ«ns was web technology.The rest of the  a course we had to do by ourselves. 
                We had one lesson given by see students about html. The rest of the  a course we had to do by ourselves. 
                The main assignment in web technology was making a worst webpage. So that we could learn how to use html. 
                I never used html before and the lesson of the students made everything a lot more clear. They told us 
                what html is and showed examples and a website with tutorials. I will say what I have learned, what the 
                difficulties were and their solutions and what I unlearned during this course.
